# Sensory-Stick-A-Smart-IoT-Solution-For-Blind-Navigation

## Project OverView
* There are so many blind people in the society, who is suffering from exercising the basic things of daily life and that could put lives at risk while travelling. There is a necessity these days to provide security and safety to blind people. There have been few devices developed so far to help the blind people. The blind stick is integrated with Multiple sensor to update to detect the person environment condition and send alert message to family members.
* In this proposed system, we have designed a Innovative Blind stick using Arduino as main Microcontroller board, and using multiple sensor such as Moisture, Ultrasonic Sensor we have designed a smart blind stick. Project working steps are as follows.
    1. Three Ultrasonic Sensor is used to detect in three direction (Left, Right and 
Front) and if the Distance is less than threshold value than it will generate a 
Voice message through speaker 
    2. If user press Emergency Switch, than a Buzzer alert will be generated and SMS 
of location will be send to the Family Members
    3. Temperature and Humidity sensor data are interfaced with Nodemcu IoT 
module to send the Environment condition data on Blynk based Cloud Server.
    4. If moisture is detected by the Sensor, than it will generate a Voice output 
message. 
- For IoT based data upload, Blynk based cloud server is used and user can view this data 
from anywhere in the world using Blynk Application.
- The power supply setup of the system contains a 12V Battery, Voltage Regulators, Filter Capacitors and Charging Circuit. 12V Output form 7812 Voltage regulator and 5V Output from Voltage regulators is used to power Microcontroller, Accelerometer and Ultrasonic Sensor. Filter capacitor are used to remove ripples from DC Voltage. Charging Circuit along with 12V adapter is used to charge the 12V battery
